David,
I'm working hard at getting your site set up.  Your domain renewal gave me a bit of a deadline.  I'm working on the parts that Airtable doesn't handle (The header and the footer and some stuff on the home page.)

You can see a screenshot below:

You'll notice some green boxes - I need that content from you.  Namely:

* Your service schedule
* You church address and phone number
* A large picture to use as the masthead for your site
* The text you want to be featured above the masthead.  This needs to be something that is descriptive.

Also, don't worry about the blue links in the picture.  They aren't going to be blue, it's a bug in my system I'm working on fixing.

Thanks,
Ryan Hayden
