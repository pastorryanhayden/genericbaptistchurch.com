**Find direction:** From the families that attend our church, to the students in our public school system, to the young person alone on the streets. One thing they all have in common is a need and desire for direction. Everyone wants to know why they are here, and what their purpose in this life is. God tells young people, in His Word, what that direction is. He says, “Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth…”. Young people here will gain a knowledge of the God who created them and loves them, and will come to know the real meaning of life.

**Find love:** We love young people at Community Baptist Church, so much so, that we try to spend as much time sharing the truth with them as we possibly can. We have :

Youth Night  . . . . . 7pm – Last Friday night of each month
Youth Activities and Outings . . . . .  See youth schedule
Summer Camps and Youth Conferences . . . .  Annually

Any young person in grades 7-12 will find a warm and loving environment to hear the Truth about God, and what He has planned for each and every person. They will find friends their own age, that also have a desire to know God.

**Find the truth:** We believe that everyone deserves to know the truth, and God has been so gracious to make it available it to anyone that is interested. The Bible says, “Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.”. The Bible gives us the truth relating to every area of our lives. We take God’s Word and share real answers that are relevant to young people, on subjects that they are dealing with now, such as:
Our Purpose in life, Forgiveness, Salvation, Friends, Courage, Music, Loneliness, Peer Pressure, Drugs and Alcohol, Guys and Girls, Temptation, Happiness, Parents and many other subjects.

God has led you to this site for a reason. Join us this week as we dive into God’s Word together. Find other young people here, that also want to know God, and you will be encouraged.
We can’t wait to meet you!
With Love, Sean and Gwen Jacobs
